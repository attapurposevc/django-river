Overview
========
Main goal of developing this framework is **to be able to edit any workflow item on the fly.** This means, all elements in workflow like states, transitions, user authorizations(permission), group authorization are editable. To do this, all data about the workflow item is persisted into DB. **Hence, they can be changed without touching the code and re-deploying your application.**

There is ordering aprovments for a transition functionality in ``django-river``. It also provides skipping specific transition of a specific objects.

**Playground**: There is a fake jira example repository as a playground of django-river. https://github.com/javrasya/fakejira
